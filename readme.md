# Sandbox_GithubPage

Testing deploying Github Page again

---

Requirements:

- Repo MUST be public
- Project must be static site
- File must be `readme.md` or `index.html`
  - index.html has higher priority
- Heading must be the same as repo name to avoid Hyperlink above the page (for readme.md)
- Push from local may be required to trigger hosted page
